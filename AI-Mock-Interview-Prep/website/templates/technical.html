                            <span class="tip-title">Master the Fundamentals</span>: Ensure a solid grasp of data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, recursion). Know time and space complexities (Big O Notation) for evaluating performance.
                        </p>

                            <span class="tip-title">Practice Problem Solving</span>: Regularly solve coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces. Focus on common problems related to arrays, strings, graphs, and trees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="tip-title">Study Company-Specific Patterns</span>: Research the kinds of questions commonly asked at your target companies. Practice mock interviews that simulate their style and difficulty level.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="tip-title">Stay Calm and Think Aloud</span>: If you're stuck, stay composed, think out loud, and ask clarifying questions. This shows your problem-solving approach and can provide hints from the interviewer.
